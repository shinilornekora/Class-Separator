# Class-Separator
This is my project for the 1st term of the second course. It reveals itself the system of class'es recognition by its attributes.
At first, we should analyze the attributes of all classes with Phisher's metric and with the method of correlation pleiades. It will divide the number of effective attributes, so we can divide classes by them. That's when we can use the method of discriminant lines or method of the 1-3 - nearest neighbors. Then the majority vote will determine the class of the object.
